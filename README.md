##  vision

A Vacation Tracking System (VTS) will provide individual employees with the 
capability to manage their own vacation time, sick leave, and personal time off, 
without having to be an expert in company policy or the local facility’s leave 
policies.
The system streamline the functions of the human resources (HR) department by providing an intuitive, intelligent, easy to use system.
This system will have the potential to save time and money mostly in the HR department.

##  Problem Defination

**All vacation time had to be approved by an immediate manager and then checked by a clerk in the HR department before it was authorized.**
**This process is slow, requires significant manual effort, and often results in delays, lost requests, and inconsistent tracking of vacation balances.***
